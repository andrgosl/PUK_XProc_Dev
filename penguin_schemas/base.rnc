# Modification of DocBook based on the Publisher's Minimal Elements list.

# 2008-05-16
# version 1.3
#            Allowed db.annotation - removal was never intended.
# 2008-03-17
# version 1.2
#             Allowed db.indexterm as we have changed the guidance on indices.
# 2007-08-01
# version 1.1
#               Corrected base.rnc because 
#              db.informaltable had been set to db.cals.table and not db.cals.informaltable
# 2008-01-08
# version  1.1.1
#             Modified base.rnc to allow db:footnote's label attribute to be a text
#             value instead of an NMTOKEN.
# 2008-11-28
# version  1.1.2
#            Removed bridgehead.
# 2008-12-18
# version  1.1.3
#            Enabled itermset - this should have been done some months ago 
#            was omitted by accident.

  # error messages in software systems.
